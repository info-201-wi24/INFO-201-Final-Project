## Summary and Purpose

The purpose of these bar plots is to analyze how does the kind of mental disorders and category of foods differ across various countries and years. We'll look to see if there's a noticeable difference in the total number of cases and calories for these different types. <br />

The first data type graph presents dietary composition, categorized by different types of food and their daily calorie intake per person. By choosing different countries and year, we can compare the calories intake by different measures.
We have found that the way people consume the most calories is through cereal and grain intake. The least amount varied between starchy roots, pulses/legumes, alcoholic beverages, and other. <br />

The second data type graph illustrates the prevalence of various mental disorders in different countries categorized by disorder type. The plots show that anxiety disorder has the highest prevalence and is followed by depressive disorder as the second highest, while eating disorder has the lowest prevalence in most countries. These results appear to stay roughly consistent throughout the years.
