## Main Takeaways

In our exploration of the relationship between mental health and diet, we uncovered interesting insights that reveal the complexity of these relationships. Our first takeaway is that over the years, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders have become the most common mental health conditions nationwide, demonstrating the prevalence of anxiety and depression around most countries in the world. Our second takeaway is that while our analysis did not reveal clear links between specific food groups and mental health disorders, we did find potential links between eating disorders and calorie intake, suggesting the need for further research into this subtle association. So although other research suggests that the kind of foods you eat can impact your mental health, the correlation is likely more clear on an individual level rather than on a population level. Our third takeaway is that the prevalence of mental health disorders has been increasing over time, highlighting the urgent need for more mental health services to address this significant public health issue. Understanding the complex relationships between socioeconomic factors, cultural influences, and dietary habits is important to develop targeted strategies to promote mental health and reduce the burden of mental illness on individuals and communities.

For the future, our findings emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and holistic approaches in addressing mental health issues. Drawing on insights from psychology, nutritional science, and public health policy, we argue that multidisciplinary partnerships allow us to develop comprehensive interventions that address the multifaceted determinants of mental health. Improving mental health literacy and access to support resources, as well as encouraging healthy dietary patterns, have the potential to increase resilience and reduce the incidence of mental health disorders. Ultimately, by recognizing the complex relationship between diet and mental health, we can pave the way for more effective strategies to promote overall well-being and build healthier, more resilient communities around the world.
