## Introduction

The pursuit of better mental health endures in the face of a world that is constantly changing. In the process, one fascinating but frequently disregarded component to mental health becomes increasingly important: our eating habits. Our initiative sets out on a investigation to discover the complex connection between our dietary habits and mental health. In order to better understand the complex relationship between dietary practices and mental health, our project will look at how different food categories' consumption patterns and the prevalence of mental disorders have evolved over time and how strongly do they affect each other. Our objective is to shed light on the value of mindful eating as a complementary strategy for not only improving physical health but mental health as well, offering knowledge that may influence dietary guidelines and public policy. <br />

Major Questions: <br />
-How does dietary composition correlate with the different mental health disorders globally from different countries for different years? <br />
-Are there specific dietary factors that are more strongly associated with certain mental health conditions? <br />
-How have diets and mental health trends differ across countries and over the years? <br />
-Can improvements in dietary habits lead to better mental health outcomes?

Original Data Sources: <br />
Mental Health Data: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mental-illness-estimated-cases <br /> 
The mental health data utilized in this project is sourced from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). <br />
This dataset encompasses estimated cases of various mental health disorders, including eating disorders, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia across 228 countries/regions from 1990 to 2019. 
The data is compiled from representative surveys, medical records, and statistical modeling. <br />
Ethical Questions/Limitation: Privacy issues with the use of sensitive mental health information, potential inaccuracies in data collection methods, and the accuracy of estimating mental health cases in different regions may exist. Additionally, there may be ethical considerations regarding the representation of marginalized communities and the impact of stigma on reporting of mental health disorders.

Dietary Composition Data: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/dietary-compositions-by-commodity-group <br />
The data is from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). <br />
This dataset provides insights into the average per capita dietary energy supply by food groups, measured in kilocalories per person per day (kcal), across 238 countries/regions from 1961 to 2020.
It includes information on various food groups such as sugars, fruits and vegetables, meat, dairy and eggs, cereal and grains, oils and fats, alcoholic drinks, starchy roots, pulses/legumes, and others. 
The data is collected through questionnaires and quantitative dietary surveys. <br />
Ethical Questions/Limitation: Concerning about the accuracy and reliability of self-reported dietary data through surveys, and reporting of dietary intake based on cultural, socioeconomic, and geographic factors. It is also important to ensure fair representation of different groups of people and to address any inequalities in access to food resources.
