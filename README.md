# Introduction
The pursuit of better mental health endures in the face of a world that is constantly changing. In the process, one fascinating but frequently disregarded component to mental health becomes increasingly important: our eating habits. Our initiative sets out on a investigation to discover the complex connection between our dietary habits and mental health. In order to better understand the complex relationship between dietary practices and mental health, our project will look at how different food categories' consumption patterns and the prevalence of mental disorders have evolved over time and how strongly do they affect each other. Our objective is to shed light on the value of mindful eating as a complementary strategy for not only improving physical health but mental health as well, offering knowledge that may influence dietary guidelines and public policy. 

Major Questions:
-How does dietary composition correlate with the different mental health disorders globally from different countries for different years? 
-Are there specific dietary factors that are more strongly associated with certain mental health conditions? 
-How have diets and mental health trends differ across countries and over the years? 
-Can improvements in dietary habits lead to better mental health outcomes?

Original Data Sources: 
Mental Health Data: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mental-illness-estimated-cases  
The mental health data utilized in this project is sourced from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). 
This dataset encompasses estimated cases of various mental health disorders, including eating disorders, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia across 228 countries/regions from 1990 to 2019. 
The data is compiled from representative surveys, medical records, and statistical modeling. 
Ethical Questions/Limitation: Privacy issues with the use of sensitive mental health information, potential inaccuracies in data collection methods, and the accuracy of estimating mental health cases in different regions may exist. Additionally, there may be ethical considerations regarding the representation of marginalized communities and the impact of stigma on reporting of mental health disorders.

Dietary Composition Data: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/dietary-compositions-by-commodity-group 
The data is from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). 
This dataset provides insights into the average per capita dietary energy supply by food groups, measured in kilocalories per person per day (kcal), across 238 countries/regions from 1961 to 2020.
It includes information on various food groups such as sugars, fruits and vegetables, meat, dairy and eggs, cereal and grains, oils and fats, alcoholic drinks, starchy roots, pulses/legumes, and others. 
The data is collected through questionnaires and quantitative dietary surveys. 
Ethical Questions/Limitation: Concerning about the accuracy and reliability of self-reported dietary data through surveys, and reporting of dietary intake based on cultural, socioeconomic, and geographic factors. It is also important to ensure fair representation of different groups of people and to address any inequalities in access to food resources.

# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
In the culmination of our Shiny app project, we have embarked on a meticulous journey to unravel the intricate associations between mental health and dietary composition, drawing upon datasets sourced from esteemed organizations such as the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Our analytical exploration aimed to elucidate the nuanced interplay between these fundamental aspects of human well-being, spanning diverse countries and encompassing several decades of data. In our exploration of the relationship between mental health and diet, we uncovered interesting insights that reveal the complexity of these relationships. 

Our first takeaway is that over the years, anxiety disorders and depressive disorders have become the most common mental health conditions nationwide, demonstrating the prevalence of anxiety and depression around most countries in the world. Our observations unveil a consistent upward trajectory in the incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders, indicative of the escalating burden of mental health challenges on a global scale. While disparities in the distribution of mental health disorders among nations are evident, the overarching narrative underscores the urgent imperative to address the multifaceted dimensions of mental health care and support.

Our second takeaway is that our scrutiny of dietary composition unveils intriguing patterns regarding food consumption habits and their potential ramifications for mental well-being. We discern cereal and grain intake as the predominant source of dietary calories across various countries, with discernible fluctuations in consumption trends over time. Notably, our analysis tentatively indicates a correlation between select dietary factors and the prevalence of eating disorders. So while our analysis did not reveal explicitly clear links between most of the specific food groups and mental health disorders, we did find potential links between eating disorders and calorie intake, suggesting the need for further research into this subtle association and accentuating the necessity for nuanced approaches to nutrition and mental health interventions. Although other research studies reveal that the kind of foods you eat can impact your mental health, the correlation is likely more clear on an individual level rather than on a population level. 

Our third takeaway is that the prevalence of mental health disorders has been increasing over time, highlighting the urgent need for more mental health services to address this significant public health issue. Understanding the complex relationships between socioeconomic factors, cultural influences, and dietary habits is important to develop targeted strategies to promote mental health and reduce the burden of mental illness on individuals and communities. Of paramount significance, our findings underscore the complex interdependencies between mental health outcomes and broader socio-cultural determinants, ranging from individual dietary choices to systemic healthcare policies. While our analysis yields valuable insights into the intricate dynamics at play, it also underscores the inherent limitations and ethical considerations intrinsic to working with sensitive health and dietary data. As custodians of data-driven inquiry, it behooves us to approach our findings with humility and empathy, cognizant of the diverse perspectives and lived experiences that inform our understanding of mental health and well-being.

In summation, our Shiny app project serves as a testament to the transformative potential of data storytelling in elucidating pressing societal challenges and fostering informed discourse on mental health and dietary practices. As we navigate the complexities of an increasingly interconnected world, may our endeavors inspire continued exploration, empathy, and advocacy in pursuit of a more equitable and resilient future for all. For the future, our findings emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and holistic approaches in addressing mental health issues. Drawing on insights from psychology, nutritional science, and public health policy, we argue that multidisciplinary partnerships allow us to develop comprehensive interventions that address the multifaceted determinants of mental health. Improving mental health literacy and access to support resources, as well as encouraging healthy dietary patterns, have the potential to increase resilience and reduce the incidence of mental health disorders. Ultimately, by recognizing the complex relationship between diet and mental health, we can pave the way for more effective strategies to promote overall well-being and build healthier, more resilient communities around the world.
