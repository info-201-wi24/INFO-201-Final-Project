## Summary and Purpose

The purpose of the scatterplot is to inspect whether there may be any associations between mental health and diet.
The x-axis displays the daily calorie intake per person, regarding different food groups while the y-axis is the number of estimated cases. We noticed that there may be some relations between eating disorders and the number of calories per food group but it's not clear enough to truly say so. For the other disorders, there seems to be no significant relationship with the type of food intake, provided that some outliers are excluded. This could be because of other stronger factors and confouding variables that haven't been accounted for that are affecting the trends in mental health and diet, which makes the correlation between the two variables less obvious.
