## Summary and Purpose

The purpose of the line plots is to examine how have the total number of estimated mental health cases and calorie intake for the different disorders and food groups changed over time. This plot helps to easily visualize the changing trends to determine whether they've relatively stayed the same, increased, or decreased. <br /> 

It has been observed that the prevalence of most of the mentioned mental disorders have been on an increasing trend from year to year, irrespective of the country in which they are found. This may be due to the rise in mental health services and mental health awareness, leading to more surveys being conducted and more people willing to participate in them. <br />

There seems to be no clear trend in the amount of calorie intake for different food categories across countries. It differs between years, sometimes increasing and other times decreasing. There may be many reasons to account for this, such as food shortages during times of crisis or the development of more food production companies and factories.
